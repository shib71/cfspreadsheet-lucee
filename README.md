#<cfspreadsheet /> for Lucee

This is a fork of the Team CFAdvance cfspreadsheet-railo extension, modified to work with the Lucee fork of Railo. Please refer to that site for more details.

##Update:
The ApachePOI jars have been updated to the latest stable version (3.11)
xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar also added as per Apache recommendtioj, though v2.3 is all that is required.
Version bumped to 4.0 because of new jars.
